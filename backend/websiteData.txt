Main Menu Search for: Search Search Home About Us Programs Menu Toggle Education Entrepreneurship Legal-mentorship Advocacy Projects & Partnerships Media & Gallery Recipients Contact About Us About The Charles Osuji Foundation A legacy built on resilience, opportunity, and the unwavering belief that everyone deserves a chance to succeed THE FOUNDATION From humble beginnings in Nigeria, Dr. Charles Osuji LL.D. (Hon.), C.Dir. has lived a story defined by perseverance, excellence, and purpose. Guided by the unwavering support of his family—who invested in his education and sponsored his immigration to Canada—he arrived in Calgary determined to turn adversity into opportunity.After facing more than 300 job rejections, his breakthrough came when Jim Smith, a Calgary lawyer, offered him a chance. That single opportunity became the foundation of an extraordinary journey: called to the Alberta Bar in 2014, becoming Partner in 2016, and by 2017, assuming full ownership of the firm that now bears both their names—Osuji & Smith Lawyers.Under his visionary leadership, Osuji & Smith Lawyers has grown from a small two-lawyer office into one of Canada’s fastest-growing mid-sized law firms, with more than 40 staff and offices in Calgary, Ottawa, Yukon, and Dubai. The firm serves clients in employment law, business law, real estate, family law, immigration, and litigation, and proudly reflects the diversity of its community—its team speaks over 30 languages and represents a mosaic of cultures and professional experiences.Recognized as a multi-award-winning, full-service law firm, Osuji & Smith’s success mirrors the resilience and inclusiveness of its leader. Dr. Osuji himself has received over 120 local, national, and international recognitions, including Canada’s Top 25 Most Influential Lawyers, Calgary’s Top 40 Under 40, the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal, and an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Mount Royal University, among others.Complementing his business leadership, Dr. Osuji holds the Chartered Director (C.Dir.)designation from the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University, reflecting his deep commitment to governance excellence, ethical leadership, and corporate accountability. He actively serves on several boards and advisory committees, bringing a principled, values-driven perspective to organizational governance and social impact.True to his roots and his calling to lift others, Dr. Osuji is the Founder of the award-winning Foot in the Door Initiative (FIDI), a mentorship and training platform that has supported more than 300 locally and internationally trained lawyers in Canada. Rooted in his own early struggles as an immigrant lawyer with no local connections, FIDI was born from his resolve that no one else should face such barriers alone. It provides the mentorship, guidance, and opportunity he once longed for—creating a pipeline of diverse talent that continues to enrich Alberta’s legal profession and Canadian society at large.The Charles Osuji Foundation is the natural extension of this same vision. It honors the mentors and family who opened doors for him and carries forward his belief that success finds its highest meaning in service to others. Through scholarships, entrepreneurial grants, and global education initiatives, Dr. Osuji is ensuring that the same doors once opened for him remain open for generations to come. Our Founder Dr. Charles Osuji: A Journey of Resilience Dr. Charles Osuji’s journey is one of perseverance, excellence, and community impact. Raised in Nigeria, he was supported by his family who invested in his education and gave him the ultimate ‘foot in the door’ by sponsoring his immigration to Canada. Arriving in Calgary with determination but facing over 300 articling rejections, Charles finally received a chance from his mentor, Jim Smith, who opened the doors of his law firm to him. From there, Charles rose quickly—called to the Alberta Bar in 2014, made Partner in 2016, and became sole owner and CEO of Osuji & Smith Lawyers in 2017.Today, he leads the largest Black-owned law firm in Canada (Osuji & Smith Lawyers), employing more than 40 staff across Calgary, Ottawa, Yukon, and Dubai. Recognized with over 120 awards—including Canada’s Top 25 Most Influential Lawyers, Calgary’s Top 40 Under 40, the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal, and an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Mount Royal University—Dr. Osuji embodies resilience and leadership. The Charles Osuji Foundation is his way of honoring those who lifted him up, while ensuring that the cycle of generosity and upliftment continues for generations to come.

Built on the principle that true success is measured by how much we uplift others, the Foundation champions emerging leaders, innovators, and changemakers whose work reflects excellence, integrity, and community service. Through initiatives like the Rise Together Grant, the Foundation provides mentorship, funding, and visibility to individuals who embody resilience, creativity, and compassion—helping them turn dreams into legacies of impact. In 2025, the Foundation celebrates five exceptional recipients of the Rise Together Grant—visionaries whose journeys span business, art, law, and advocacy. Each story captures the Foundation’s belief that greatness grows when we rise together. 1. Tasa Ojeogwu — Founder & Chef, Tasa’s Tasty Kitchen “Happiness is homemade, and excellence is our watchword.”Few stories capture the fusion of culture, entrepreneurship, and purpose like that of Tasa Ojeogwu, the founder of Tasa’s Tasty Kitchen. What began as a simple desire to share the flavours of home has grown into an award-winning business recognized as Calgary’s Best Private Chef (2023) by NaijaprenuerCanada. Her culinary brand celebrates Nigerian cuisine with authenticity and innovation. From her signature Naija Puff Puffs to the pioneering Puff Puff Mix—now stocked in over ten storesacross Calgary and Airdrie, including No Frills—Tasa has made traditional Nigerian snacks a mainstream delight. Her participation in major cultural events such as the Calgary Stampede, Innovate Calgary, and the Ethnik Festivals has positioned her as a culturalambassador for Nigerian gastronomy in Canada.A scientist at heart, with a degree in microbiology and ongoing medical studies, Tasa brings precision and discipline to her culinary craft. Beyond her business success, she dedicates time to community mentorship through her monthly Intentional Teens Hangouts, whereYoung people learn life skills, discuss purpose, and build faith-based resilience.“Cooking is my medium for service,” she explains. “It nourishes the body and uplifts the spirit.” With her sights set on scaling production and expanding her brand across Canada, Tasa’s story reminds us that business, when rooted in purpose, can transform both lives and communities.Email: tasastastykitchen@gmail.comInstagram: @tasastastykitchen 2. Damipe (“Peace”) Aladesemipe — Law Student & Community Advocate “Being in law school isn’t just my dream — it’s my way of giving back.” At only 23, Damipe Aladesemipe stands as a voice of determination and compassion within Calgary’s growing community of young leaders. As a first-generation Nigerian-Canadian and the first in her family to pursue higher education, her journey to law school is both personal and symbolic—a testament to perseverance and faith. Before entering the University of Calgary’s Faculty of Law, Damipe completed a Bachelor of Social Work with a minor in Law & Society. She gained hands-on experience at the City of Calgary’s Community Strategies Division, shaping policies around food security, anti-racism, and accessibility. Her work with the Women’s Centre of Calgary and the Workers’ Resource Centre gave her deep insight into the challenges marginalized groups face in navigating justice and employment systems. Today, Damipe serves with Student Legal Assistance and the Black Law Students’ Association (BLSA), where she mentors peers and advocates for equity in the legal profession. Her long-term goal is to establish a community-based legal clinic offering pro bono services to immigrants and low-income families. “I want every young Black student to see that they belong in these spaces,” she says. For Damipe, the Rise Together Grant represents both support and validation—a reminder that her story matters, and her impact is only beginning. LinkedIn: Damipe (“Peace”) Aladesemipe University of Calgary Faculty of Law 3. Victor Ezesinachi Okoli — Scholar & Founder, MOGA Initiative “We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.”From his roots in Orumba, Nigeria, to his current studies at the University of Calgary Faculty of Law, Victor Ezesinachi Okoli’s journey reflects one consistent truth: success is most meaningful when shared. Armed with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Nigeria and distinction from the Nigerian Law School, Victor joined Olaniwun Ajayi LP—West Africa’s largest law firm—where he advised on multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects, including Nigeria’s Fourth Mainland Bridge and renewable energy developments. Yet, his greatest pride lies in service. In 2018, Victor founded Making Orumba Great Again (MOGA), a nonprofit organization improving educational access for thousands of youths. MOGA has donated more than 2,000 books, launched an annual Readers’ Challenge, hosted career summits for over 5,000 students, and provided scholarships to high-achieving learners. His work earned recognition from the Anambra State Government and international partners.Today, Victor is pursuing a Master of Laws in Natural Resources, Energy, and Environmental Law at UCalgary, researching cybersecurity risks in renewable energy. As a student caseworker with Student Legal Assistance, he offers pro bono legal help to low-income residents of Calgary. His dream is to serve as a bridge between Nigeria and Canada—advancing sustainable energy policy and educational opportunity across continents.“My calling has always been to use the law not only to interpret justice but to extend it,”Victor reflects.LinkedIn: Victor Ezesinachi OkolieUniversity of Calgary Faculty of Law 4. Aremu Oluwafunmilayo — Founder, Ayaba Beauty Place “I believe every woman should see herself as royalty — that’s what Ayaba means.” When Aremu Oluwafunmilayo founded Ayaba Beauty Place, her goal was simple yet powerful—to redefine how women of colour see themselves. Having faced the challenges of navigating the beauty industry as a newcomer, she saw firsthand how few spaces truly celebrated African hair textures and styles. Ayaba, meaning “queen”; in Yoruba, became her response: a brand that empowers women to wear their crowns with pride. Since its launch in 2024, Ayaba Beauty Place has evolved into a vibrant Calgary-based enterprise offering wig revamps, braided wigs, makeup artistry, and photography. Through over 50 free online tutorials, Aremu has built a loyal following, teaching women the art of self-expression and confidence through natural beauty. Her business has become a beacon for inclusivity, encouraging women of colour to embrace authenticity. Beyond her thriving brand, Aremu volunteers with ActionDignity, supporting racialized and newcomer communities. Her plans include donating custom braided wigs to charities serving Black children and opening a walk-in beauty hub that combines hair, makeup, and photography under one roof. Her long-term vision is not just to style hair, but to inspire women to see their inherent worth. “Every woman who sits in my chair leaves with more than a new look—she leaves reminded of her value,” Aremu shares.

Chidera Uzoka — Founder, Dera Art Studio “Art isn’t just expression — it’s education, representation, and empowerment.”For multidisciplinary artist and entrepreneur Chidera Uzoka, art is a calling—a way to preserve culture, challenge narratives, and connect communities. Her company, Dera Art Studio, was born from a desire to tell stories that often go unheard, using visual art and design as her language of advocacy.After five years of building an online presence, Chidera expanded her practice into a physical studio at the NVRLND Arts Foundation. Her debut solo exhibition, Echoes, became a landmark event in Alberta’s art community, drawing over 150 attendees—including the Minister of Arts, Culture, and the Status of Women.

Main Menu Search for: Search Search Home About Us Programs Menu Toggle Education Entrepreneurship Legal-mentorship Advocacy Projects & Partnerships Media & Gallery Recipients Contact About-2.1 Welcome To The Charles Osuji Foundation Dr. Charles Osuji: A Journey of Resilience, Leadership, and PurposeFrom humble beginnings in Nigeria, Dr. Charles Osuji LL.D. (Hon.), C.Dir. has lived a story defined by perseverance, excellence, and purpose. Guided by the unwavering support of his family—who invested in his education and sponsored his immigration to Canada—he arrived in Calgary determined to turn adversity into opportunity.After facing more than 300 job rejections, his breakthrough came when Jim Smith, a Calgary lawyer, offered him a chance. That single opportunity became the foundation of an extraordinary journey: called to the Alberta Bar in 2014, becoming Partner in 2016, and by 2017, assuming full ownership of the firm that now bears both their names—Osuji & Smith Lawyers.Under his visionary leadership, Osuji & Smith Lawyers has grown from a small two-lawyer office into one of Canada’s fastest-growing mid-sized law firms, with more than 40 staff and offices in Calgary, Ottawa, Yukon, and Dubai. The firm serves clients in employment law, business law, real estate, family law, immigration, and litigation, and proudly reflects the diversity of its community—its team speaks over 30 languages and represents a mosaic of cultures and professional experiences.Recognized as a multi-award-winning, full-service law firm, Osuji & Smith’s success mirrors the resilience and inclusiveness of its leader. Dr. Osuji himself has received over 120 local, national, and international recognitions, including Canada’s Top 25 Most Influential Lawyers, Calgary’s Top 40 Under 40, the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal, and an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Mount Royal University, among others.Complementing his business leadership, Dr. Osuji holds the Chartered Director (C.Dir.)designation from the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University, reflecting his deep commitment to governance excellence, ethical leadership, and corporate accountability. He actively serves on several boards and advisory committees, bringing a principled, values-driven perspective to organizational governance and social impact.True to his roots and his calling to lift others, Dr. Osuji is the Founder of the award-winning Foot in the Door Initiative (FIDI), a mentorship and training platform that has supported more than 300 locally and internationally trained lawyers in Canada. Rooted in his own early struggles as an immigrant lawyer with no local connections, FIDI was born from his resolve that no one else should face such barriers alone. It provides the mentorship, guidance, and opportunity he once longed for—creating a pipeline of diverse talent that continues to enrich Alberta’s legal profession and Canadian society at large.The Charles Osuji Foundation is the natural extension of this same vision. It honors the mentors and family who opened doors for him and carries forward his belief that success finds its highest meaning in service to others. Through scholarships, entrepreneurial grants, and global education initiatives, Dr. Osuji is ensuring that the same doors once opened for him remain open for generations to come. NCAC Gala Partnership The Charles Osuji Foundation: Building Legacies, Changing NarrativesThe story of The Charles Osuji Foundation is inseparable from the personal journey of its founder — one marked by resilience, opportunity, and a deep sense of responsibility to give back.As a young man in Nigeria, Dr. Charles Osuji’s path was shaped by the sacrifices of those who believed in him. From his parents to his elder brother, Rev. Fr. Dr. Tony Osuji, who paid for his education from primary school through law school, his eldest brother, Professor Joseph Osuji, who sponsored him to Canada, giving him the ultimate “foot in the door”, and his mentor, Jim Smith, who gave him a chance when no one else would, opening the doors of his law firm (now, Osuji & Smith Lawyers) to him after more than 300 rejections. He has also benefited from the support of the rest of his family, friends, colleagues and so many mentors within the Nigerian community in Canada. Each of these people invested in Dr. Osuji, and each act of generosity became the foundation upon which he has built his life and career.When Dr. Charles Osuji stood on stage at the NCACGala in October 2024 to accept the association’s Distinguished Achievement Award, he announced the launch of The Charles Osuji Foundation with an initial donation of $10,000. That gift marked the beginning of a long-term commitment: to give at least $10,000 every year for the next 10 years, specifically through NCAC (labeled, the “Rise Together Grant”).That means $100,000 will flow directly into scholarships and entrepreneurial grants designed to uplift and support members of the community. This is in addition to other philanthropic goals of the Foundation in Canada, Nigeria and elsewhere, and his law firm’s not-for-profit, Foot in the Door Initiative (FIDI), which provides Canadian legal experience to internationally trained lawyers and immigrant lawyers in Canada.The goal is simple but profound: to ensure that no student or entrepreneur in the community feels they must walk their path alone. The Foundation provides scholarships for Nigerian-Canadian students in law and pre-law programs, and grants for entrepreneurs within their first two years of business. These are the stages of life where support is most critical — when the journey is new, the risks are highest, and the encouragement of one person or one organization can make the difference between success and defeat.But this is about more than money. It is about changing the narrative of what community associations represent. Too often, community associations are seen as places for cultural events, gatherings, “owambe” or symbolic gestures. Those are important, but they are not enough. Associations like NCAC must be conduits for tangible support and upliftment — practical engines of growth that channel the strength of the community into the lives of those who need it most.Through this Foundation, Dr. Charles Osuji wants to show that it can be done. If established professionals, entrepreneurs, and executives harness their resources, community associations can become launch pads for the next generation of leaders, lawyers, doctors, business owners, accountants, engineers, teachers, innovators and other professionals. We can create a culture where success is not hoarded but shared; where the ladder climbed is firmly held for the person coming behind.This is not just his responsibility. It is a shared responsibility. That is why Dr. Osuji challenges every established professional in the community — whether in business, medicine, engineering, academia, or the arts — to consider what they can give back. Not just in symbolic gestures, but in meaningful, measurable commitments that will empower someone else’s journey.The Charles Osuji Foundation is his way of honouring those who invested in him, while ensuring that the cycle of generosity and upliftment continues. Through NCAC, he is privileged to plant seeds that will grow into futures brighter than we can imagine. His hope is that others will join him, so that together, the community can transform its association into a beacon of opportunity, a place where dreams are nurtured, and where no one is left behind.In giving, we change not only the lives of others but the destiny of the community. That is the legacy Dr. Charles Osuji hopes to leave, and the invitation he extends to each of you.Congratulations to the winners of this year’s Rise Together Grant through The Charles Osuji Foundation!“Community associations must be more than gatherings — they must be engines of opportunity. That is the vision behind this commitment.” — Dr. Charles Osuji The Charles Osuji Foundation Empowering students, entrepreneurs, and marginalized communities through scholarships, grants, mentorship, and global education initiatives.

Who is charles Osuji? Charles Osuji’s journey is one of perseverance, excellence, and community impact. Raised in Nigeria, he was supported by his family who invested in his education and gave him the ultimate ‘foot in the door’ by sponsoring his immigration to Canada. Arriving in Calgary with determination but facing over 300 articling rejections, Charles finally received a chance from his mentor, Jim Smith, who opened the doors of his law firm to him. From there, Charles rose quickly—called to the Alberta Bar in 2014, made Partner in 2016, and became sole owner and CEO of Osuji & Smith Lawyers in 2017.

Today, he leads the largest Black-owned law firm in Canada (Osuji & Smith Lawyers), employing more than 40 staff across Calgary, Ottawa, Yukon, and Dubai. Recognized with over 120 awards—including Canada’s Top 25 Most Influential Lawyers, Calgary’s Top 40 Under 40, the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal, and an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Mount Royal University—Dr. Osuji embodies resilience and leadership. The Charles Osuji Foundation is his way of honoring those who lifted him up, while ensuring that the cycle of generosity and upliftment continues for generations to come.

2025 Charles Osuji Foundation Grant Recipients: Rising Together Through Purpose, Service & Impact
The Charles Osuji Foundation was established to empower individuals and communities through education, entrepreneurship, and social impact. Built on the principle that true success is measured by how much we uplift others, the Foundation champions emerging leaders, innovators, and changemakers whose work reflects excellence, integrity, and community service. Through initiatives like the Rise Together Grant, the Foundation provides mentorship, funding, and visibility to individuals who embody resilience, creativity, and compassion—helping them turn dreams into legacies of impact. In 2025, the Foundation celebrates five exceptional recipients of the Rise Together Grant—visionaries whose journeys span business, art, law, and advocacy. Each story captures the Foundation’s belief that greatness grows when we rise together.
1. Tasa Ojeogwu — Founder & Chef, Tasa’s Tasty Kitchen

“Happiness is homemade, and excellence is our watchword.”
Few stories capture the fusion of culture, entrepreneurship, and purpose like that of Tasa Ojeogwu, the founder of Tasa’s Tasty Kitchen. What began as a simple desire to share the flavours of home has grown into an award-winning business recognized as Calgary’s Best Private Chef (2023) by NaijaprenuerCanada. Her culinary brand celebrates Nigerian cuisine with authenticity and innovation. From her signature Naija Puff Puffs to the pioneering Puff Puff Mix—now stocked in over ten stores
across Calgary and Airdrie, including No Frills—Tasa has made traditional Nigerian snacks a mainstream delight. Her participation in major cultural events such as the Calgary Stampede, Innovate Calgary, and the Ethnik Festivals has positioned her as a cultural
ambassador for Nigerian gastronomy in Canada.
A scientist at heart, with a degree in microbiology and ongoing medical studies, Tasa brings precision and discipline to her culinary craft. Beyond her business success, she dedicates time to community mentorship through her monthly Intentional Teens Hangouts, where
Young people learn life skills, discuss purpose, and build faith-based resilience.
“Cooking is my medium for service,” she explains. “It nourishes the body and uplifts the spirit.” With her sights set on scaling production and expanding her brand across Canada, Tasa’s story reminds us that business, when rooted in purpose, can transform both lives and communities.

2. Damipe (“Peace”) Aladesemipe — Law Student & Community Advocate

“Being in law school isn’t just my dream — it’s my way of giving back.” At only 23, Damipe Aladesemipe stands as a voice of determination and compassion within Calgary’s growing community of young leaders. As a first-generation Nigerian-Canadian and the first in her family to pursue higher education, her journey to law school is both personal and symbolic—a testament to perseverance and faith. Before entering the University of Calgary’s Faculty of Law, Damipe completed a Bachelor of Social Work with a minor in Law & Society. She gained hands-on experience at the City of Calgary’s Community Strategies Division, shaping policies around food security, anti-racism, and accessibility. Her work with the Women’s Centre of Calgary and the Workers’ Resource Centre gave her deep insight into the challenges marginalized groups face in navigating justice and employment systems. Today, Damipe serves with Student Legal Assistance and the Black Law Students’ Association (BLSA), where she mentors peers and advocates for equity in the legal profession. Her long-term goal is to establish a community-based legal clinic offering pro bono services to immigrants and low-income families. “I want every young Black student to see that they belong in these spaces,” she says. For Damipe, the Rise Together Grant represents both support and validation—a reminder that her story matters, and her impact is only beginning.

3. Victor Ezesinachi Okoli — Scholar & Founder, MOGA Initiative

“We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.”

From his roots in Orumba, Nigeria, to his current studies at the University of Calgary Faculty of Law, Victor Ezesinachi Okoli’s journey reflects one consistent truth: success is most meaningful when shared. Armed with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Nigeria and distinction from the Nigerian Law School, Victor joined Olaniwun Ajayi LP—West Africa’s largest law firm—where he advised on multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects, including Nigeria’s Fourth Mainland Bridge and renewable energy developments. Yet, his greatest pride lies in service. In 2018, Victor founded Making Orumba Great Again (MOGA), a nonprofit organization improving educational access for thousands of youths.

4. Aremu Oluwafunmilayo — Founder, Ayaba Beauty Place

“I believe every woman should see herself as royalty — that’s what Ayaba means.” When Aremu Oluwafunmilayo founded Ayaba Beauty Place, her goal was simple yet powerful—to redefine how women of colour see themselves. Having faced the challenges of navigating the beauty industry as a newcomer, she saw firsthand how few spaces truly celebrated African hair textures and styles. Ayaba, meaning “queen”; in Yoruba, became her response: a brand that empowers women to wear their crowns with pride. Since its launch in 2024, Ayaba Beauty Place has evolved into a vibrant Calgary-based enterprise offering wig revamps, braided wigs, makeup artistry, and photography. Through over 50 free online tutorials, Aremu has built a loyal following, teaching women the art of self-expression and confidence through natural beauty. Her business has become a beacon for inclusivity, encouraging women of colour to embrace authenticity. Beyond her thriving brand, Aremu volunteers with ActionDignity, supporting racialized and newcomer communities. Her plans include donating custom braided wigs to charities serving Black children and opening a walk-in beauty hub that combines hair, makeup, and photography under one roof. Her long-term vision is not just to style hair, but to inspire women to see their inherent worth. “Every woman who sits in my chair leaves with more than a new look—she leaves reminded of her value,” Aremu shares.

5. Chidera Uzoka — Founder, Dera Art Studio

“Art isn’t just expression — it’s education, representation, and empowerment.”
For multidisciplinary artist and entrepreneur Chidera Uzoka, art is a calling—a way to preserve culture, challenge narratives, and connect communities. Her company, Dera Art Studio, was born from a desire to tell stories that often go unheard, using visual art and design as her language of advocacy.
After five years of building an online presence, Chidera expanded her practice into a physical studio at the NVRLND Arts Foundation. Her debut solo exhibition, Echoes, became a landmark event in Alberta’s art community, drawing over 150 attendees—including the Minister of Arts, Culture, and the Status of Women. Through striking imagery, Chidera explored identity, belonging, and the shared human experience, transforming her exhibition into a space of dialogue and healing.
In addition to her artistic pursuits, Chidera has dedicated herself to arts education. She teaches oil painting and digital art to children and youth, giving them both technical skills and creative confidence. Her rebranding work for the Mount Royal University Conservatory and the University of Calgary’s Crowchild Classic showcases her versatility as a designer whose art influences institutional identity.
“I want people to see art not as a luxury but as a bridge—a way to connect, reflect, and build community,” she says. Looking ahead, Chidera envisions Dera Art Studio as a sustainable hub that merges fine art, design, and mentorship, amplifying diverse voices within Alberta’s creative ecosystem.

Follow the Journey

THE FOUNDATION
From humble beginnings in Nigeria, Dr. Charles Osuji LL.D. (Hon.), C.Dir. has lived a story defined by perseverance, excellence, and purpose. Guided by the unwavering support of his family—who invested in his education and sponsored his immigration to Canada—he arrived in Calgary determined to turn adversity into opportunity.

After facing more than 300 job rejections, his breakthrough came when Jim Smith, a Calgary lawyer, offered him a chance. That single opportunity became the foundation of an extraordinary journey: called to the Alberta Bar in 2014, becoming Partner in 2016, and by 2017, assuming full ownership of the firm that now bears both their names—Osuji & Smith Lawyers.

Under his visionary leadership, Osuji & Smith Lawyers has grown from a small two-lawyer office into one of Canada’s fastest-growing mid-sized law firms, with more than 40 staff and offices in Calgary, Ottawa, Yukon, and Dubai. The firm serves clients in employment law, business law, real estate, family law, immigration, and litigation, and proudly reflects the diversity of its community—its team speaks over 30 languages and represents a mosaic of cultures and professional experiences.

Recognized as a multi-award-winning, full-service law firm, Osuji & Smith’s success mirrors the resilience and inclusiveness of its leader. Dr. Osuji himself has received over 120 local, national, and international recognitions, including Canada’s Top 25 Most Influential Lawyers, Calgary’s Top 40 Under 40, the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal, and an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from Mount Royal University, among others.

Complementing his business leadership, Dr. Osuji holds the Chartered Director (C.Dir.)designation from the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University, reflecting his deep commitment to governance excellence, ethical leadership, and corporate accountability. He actively serves on several boards and advisory committees, bringing a principled, values-driven perspective to organizational governance and social impact.

True to his roots and his calling to lift others, Dr. Osuji is the Founder of the award-winning Foot in the Door Initiative (FIDI), a mentorship and training platform that has supported more than 300 locally and internationally trained lawyers in Canada. Rooted in his own early struggles as an immigrant lawyer with no local connections, FIDI was born from his resolve that no one else should face such barriers alone. It provides the mentorship, guidance, and opportunity he once longed for—creating a pipeline of diverse talent that continues to enrich Alberta’s legal profession and Canadian society at large.

The Charles Osuji Foundation is the natural extension of this same vision. It honors the mentors and family who opened doors for him and carries forward his belief that success finds its highest meaning in service to others. Through scholarships, entrepreneurial grants, and global education initiatives, Dr. Osuji is ensuring that the same doors once opened for him remain open for generations to come.

NCAC Gala Partnership
The Charles Osuji Foundation: Building Legacies, Changing Narratives

The story of The Charles Osuji Foundation is inseparable from the personal journey of its founder — one marked by resilience, opportunity, and a deep sense of responsibility to give back.

As a young man in Nigeria, Dr. Charles Osuji’s path was shaped by the sacrifices of those who believed in him. From his parents to his elder brother, Rev. Fr. Dr. Tony Osuji, who paid for his education from primary school through law school, his eldest brother, Professor Joseph Osuji, who sponsored him to Canada, giving him the ultimate “foot in the door”, and his mentor, Jim Smith, who gave him a chance when no one else would, opening the doors of his law firm (now, Osuji & Smith Lawyers) to him after more than 300 rejections. He has also benefited from the support of the rest of his family, friends, colleagues and so many mentors within the Nigerian community in Canada. Each of these people invested in Dr. Osuji, and each act of generosity became the foundation upon which he has built his life and career.

When Dr. Charles Osuji stood on stage at the NCACGala in October 2024 to accept the association’s Distinguished Achievement Award, he announced the launch of The Charles Osuji Foundation with an initial donation of $10,000. That gift marked the beginning of a long-term commitment: to give at least $10,000 every year for the next 10 years, specifically through NCAC (labeled, the “Rise Together Grant”).That means $100,000 will flow directly into scholarships and entrepreneurial grants designed to uplift and support members of the community. This is in addition to other philanthropic goals of the Foundation in Canada, Nigeria and elsewhere, and his law firm’s not-for-profit, Foot in the Door Initiative (FIDI), which provides Canadian legal experience to internationally trained lawyers and immigrant lawyers in Canada.

The goal is simple but profound: to ensure that no student or entrepreneur in the community feels they must walk their path alone. The Foundation provides scholarships for Nigerian-Canadian students in law and pre-law programs, and grants for entrepreneurs within their first two years of business. These are the stages of life where support is most critical — when the journey is new, the risks are highest, and the encouragement of one person or one organization can make the difference between success and defeat.

But this is about more than money. It is about changing the narrative of what community associations represent. Too often, community associations are seen as places for cultural events, gatherings, “owambe” or symbolic gestures. Those are important, but they are not enough. Associations like NCAC must be conduits for tangible support and upliftment — practical engines of growth that channel the strength of the community into the lives of those who need it most.

Through this Foundation, Dr. Charles Osuji wants to show that it can be done. If established professionals, entrepreneurs, and executives harness their resources, community associations can become launch pads for the next generation of leaders, lawyers, doctors, business owners, accountants, engineers, teachers, innovators and other professionals. We can create a culture where success is not hoarded but shared; where the ladder climbed is firmly held for the person coming behind.

This is not just his responsibility. It is a shared responsibility. That is why Dr. Osuji challenges every established professional in the community — whether in business, medicine, engineering, academia, or the arts — to consider what they can give back. Not just in symbolic gestures, but in meaningful, measurable commitments that will empower someone else’s journey.

The Charles Osuji Foundation is his way of honouring those who invested in him, while ensuring that the cycle of generosity and upliftment continues. Through NCAC, he is privileged to plant seeds that will grow into futures brighter than we can imagine. His hope is that others will join him, so that together, the community can transform its association into a beacon of opportunity, a place where dreams are nurtured, and where no one is left behind.

In giving, we change not only the lives of others but the destiny of the community. That is the legacy Dr. Charles Osuji hopes to leave, and the invitation he extends to each of you.

Congratulations to the winners of this year’s Rise Together Grant through The Charles Osuji Foundation!

“Community associations must be more than gatherings — they must be engines of opportunity. That is the vision behind this commitment.” — Dr. Charles Osuji
